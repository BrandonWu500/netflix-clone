# netflix-clone-frontend

## What I Learned / Gained Experience With

- Next.js
- TypeScript
- Module Sass
- Cloning a popular website's ui
- Building a more advanced image slider
- Navigation and Redirects in Next.js
- Fetching multiple datasets at the same time

## App Features

- Netflix style image sliders
- Card that appears on slide hover
- Fullscreen videos
- User login with react context api
- Next.js redirects if user isn't logged in
- Navbar that animates between transparent and black background

## Future Improvements

- Add backend (probably MongoDB along with Node.js and Express)
- Add seamless wrap around for image sliders (between first and last set of slides)
- Add modal when clicking more info button in the hover card
